## Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Foundation

Quantum-Shield implements **NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography** with the following security guarantees:

#### Core Algorithms

| Component | Algorithm | Security Level | Quantum Resistance |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Key Encapsulation** | ML-KEM-1024 (FIPS 203) | NIST Level 5 | ‚úÖ Quantum-Safe |
| **Digital Signatures** | ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204) | NIST Level 5 | ‚úÖ Quantum-Safe |
| **Symmetric Encryption** | AES-256-GCM | 128-bit classical | ‚úÖ Grover-Resistant |
| **Key Derivation** | HKDF-SHA3-384 | 192-bit classical | ‚úÖ Grover-Resistant |
| **Hashing** | BLAKE3 | 128-bit classical | ‚úÖ Grover-Resistant |

#### Security Properties

- **Quantum Resistance**: Safe against both Shor's algorithm (breaks RSA/ECC) and Grover's algorithm (weakens symmetric crypto)
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of long-term keys doesn't affect past encrypted sessions
- **Non-Repudiation**: ML-DSA-87 signatures provide cryptographic proof of file origin
- **Integrity Protection**: Multiple layers including BLAKE3 hashes, AEAD tags, and digital signatures
- **Authenticity**: Cryptographic verification of file creator identity through trust store

### Implementation Security

#### Memory Safety

- **Automatic Zeroization**: All sensitive data is automatically cleared from memory
- **Secure Memory Allocation**: Cryptographic operations use locked memory pages
- **No Unsafe Code**: Memory-safe Rust implementation without unsafe blocks
- **Side-Channel Protection**: Constant-time operations for cryptographic functions

#### Input Validation

- **Comprehensive Validation**: All external inputs are validated before processing
- **Fail-Closed Security**: Invalid inputs result in secure failure modes
- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Rust's memory safety prevents buffer overflows
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: Checked arithmetic operations throughout

#### Error Handling

- **No Information Leakage**: Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- **Secure Failure Modes**: Failures default to the most secure state
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events are logged for audit purposes

## Security Features

### Encryption Security

#### Multi-Recipient Support

- **Independent Key Wrapping**: Each recipient gets their own encrypted copy of the file key
- **No Key Sharing**: Recipients cannot decrypt files intended for others
- **Scalable Security**: Adding recipients doesn't weaken security for existing ones

#### Streaming AEAD

- **Chunk-Based Encryption**: Large files are encrypted in secure chunks
- **Unique Nonces**: Each chunk uses a cryptographically unique nonce
- **Authenticated Encryption**: Both confidentiality and integrity protection
- **Efficient Processing**: Memory-efficient streaming for large files

### Signature Security

#### ML-DSA-87 Implementation

- **Default-On Signing**: All files are signed by default for authenticity
- **Detached Signatures**: Signatures are separate from encrypted content
- **Canonical Serialization**: Deterministic header signing for consistency
- **Trust Store Integration**: Comprehensive signer verification system

#### Verification Process

- **Mandatory Verification**: Signature verification required before decryption
- **Trust Store Validation**: Signers must be in the trusted signer database
- **Signature Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of signature validity
- **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic proof of file origin and authenticity

### Key Management Security

#### Key Generation

- **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses OS-provided secure random number generation
- **Proper Entropy**: Sufficient entropy for all cryptographic operations
- **Key Separation**: Different keys for different purposes and recipients
- **Secure Storage**: Keys stored with appropriate file system permissions

#### Key Derivation

- **HKDF-SHA3-384**: Industry-standard key derivation function
- **Domain Separation**: Different contexts use different derived keys
- **Salt Usage**: Unique salts prevent rainbow table attacks
- **Key Stretching**: Computational cost for brute force attacks
